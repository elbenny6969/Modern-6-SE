# Modern 6 SE (Stock Edition)

## The world's sharpest iOS 6 theme comes to stock iOS.

## About

With Modern 6 SE, you no longer need to jailbreak your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch to get Modern 6's incredibly sharp iOS 6 icons! Modern 6 SE includes over 100 iOS 6 app icons taken directly from Modern 6. 

Each individual app icon is  incredibly sharp and are intentionally built to look amazing on all of the current iPhone displays. Each icon is compared directly to an iPhone 5 running iOS 6 to ensure the best look possible and that each icon is nearly identical to its original icon.*
